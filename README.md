Work Day Scheduler:

I created daily planner to make work time schedules
The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar using a Third Party API to call for the local time.
You are presented with time blocks for standard business hours for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a time block I can enter an event and click the save button for that time block. The text for that event is saved in local storage, when I refresh the page the saved events persist.
